// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
function crcar(manufacturer, model, ...properties) {
    var car = { manufacturer, model, };
    for (var [key, value] of properties) {
        car[key] = value;
    }
    return car;
}
var mycar = crcar("toyota", "Corolla", ["Color", "red"], ["opt feature", "Sunroof"]);
console.log(mycar);
export {};
